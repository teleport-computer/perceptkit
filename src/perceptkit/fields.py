"""Single source of truth for agent-facing perception projection.

A host typically has more than one code path that lets an agent pull the
current perception state (e.g. a CLI/tools path and a hosted runtime path).
Both should project perception_state through THIS map, so the agent sees
exactly the same signals/fields no matter which path served the request --
no second, stale catalog.

Add a new agent-pullable signal/field here ONCE and every path picks it up.

# point (a dedicated single-signal route, a bulk/list route, a different
# runtime's own adapter) and only one of them remembers to check the switch —
# a capability the user turned off stays readable through whichever path
# forgot. Keeping the judgment here, next to projection and glance (the only
# two callers), makes that class of bug structurally harder to reintroduce.
