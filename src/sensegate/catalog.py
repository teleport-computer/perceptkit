"""Capability catalog — the single source of truth for Extended Perception.

Every perceptual capability is declared here ONCE. This drives all the generic
machinery:
  - the report endpoint (which input fields are accepted, which permission gates
    them, how raw values resolve to labels, which state fields they produce)
  - the snapshot endpoint (which fields are cheap context, their freshness TTL)
  - wake triggering (which capabilities are wake sources + their debounce)
  - the transparency UI (label + tier + default-on per capability)

Adding a Tier 2 capability = adding rows here + (if it has query tools) a thin
MCP pass-through. No changes to service/routes logic.

Privacy: capabilities whose `resolver` is set accept RAW values (lat/lon, ssid,
bundle id) and resolve them to coarse labels via the user's perception_config.
The raw value is used transiently and never written to perception_state, so the
agent only ever sees labels.
